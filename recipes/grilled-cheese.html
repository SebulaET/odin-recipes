        <h3>Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Flare</h3>
            <p>What is in my opinion the <em>perfect</em> grilled cheese has few ingredients and few steps. You start with cheese of course; I like 
                to keep it original and just go american or if I'm feeling extra throw in some Muenster. You can do any <strong>melty</strong> cheese you like!
                The next thing you'll need is good bread. Try something beefy like texas toast for that classic look or sourdough if you're
                already going in on <em>wild</em> cheese.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>American cheese or other melty cheese</li>
                    <li>Texas toast</li>
                    <li>Mayo</li>
                    <li>Butter</li>
                    <li>Stuffed Olives</li>
                </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat a skillet to medium.</li>
                    <li>Slice up cheese.</li>
                    <li>Mayo both sides of both slices of bread.</li>
                    <li>Butter pan and place a piece of bread down.</li>
                    <li>Add cheese to your bread then top with other slice.</li>
                    <li>Give it about 2 minutes or until you can see the cheese melt and then flip.</li>
                    <li>Give this side about a minute.</li>
                    <li>Remove from pan, slice diagonally, apply olive to top. You can use a toothpick or just set it on there.</li>
                </ol>
